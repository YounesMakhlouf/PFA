## Entity Relationship Diagram

The file `entity_diagram.puml` contains a PlantUML diagram that describes the data model of our application. It shows the relationships between:

- Users (Educators and Children)
- Games, Levels, and Screens
- Game options and match pairs
- Progress tracking (sessions and attempts)

To view this diagram:
1. Install a PlantUML viewer extension in your IDE
2. Or use an online PlantUML viewer like [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com/)
3. Copy the contents of the file and paste it into the viewer

The diagram helps visualize how different components of our application relate to each other and serves as a reference for development.
